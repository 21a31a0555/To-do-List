# To-Do List

A simple web-based To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) to-do list items. The application is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, with a clean and minimalistic interface.

## Features

## Technologies Used

From there, you can create new to-do list items by clicking the "Add Item" button, view all items by clicking the "View All" button, and update or delete existing items by clicking the "Edit" or "Delete" buttons next to each item.
